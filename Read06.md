## What Is Node.js?
  
   - project’s home page defination:
   - __Node.js__:is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
   - Stack Overflow's defination:
   - __Node.js__: is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
   
   - __The V8 engine__: is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi.
     - It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
   - the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it. 
   
      -with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.
   
   ---------
   ## Node Binaries vs Version Manager:
     - There are various advantages to using a version manager. 
     - For example, it negates potential permission issues when using Node with npm and lets you set a Node version on a per-project basis.
     
  -----------
  ## Node.js  Supporting:
  - Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond.
  - this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax.
  - It also means that you don’t generally have to worry about compatibility issues.
  __________
  ## Installing a Package Globally:
  -  Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm.
  - This command (npm -v): To check which version you have installed on your system.
  - This command (npm install -g jshint): To install the jshint package globally on your system. 
  - This command (jshint index.js):To see a number of ES6-related errors.
     - to fix them up, add /* jshint esversion: 6 */ to the top of the js file, re-run the command and linting should pass.
____________
## Installing a Package Locally:
  - Create a test folder and open a terminal in that directory.
  - Then this command(npm init -y): To  create and auto-populate a package.json file in the same folder. 
  - Then this command(npm install lodash --save): to install the lodash package using npm and save it as a project dependency.
  - Then Create a file named test.js and add the following:
    - const _ = require('lodash');
    - const arr = [0, 1, false, 2, '', 3];
    - console.log(_.compact(arr));
 - run the script using node test.js. 
   - To see [ 1, 2, 3 ] output to the terminal.

-  if you want to start developing apps with any modern JavaScript framework (for example, React or Angular),
   -  you’ll be expected to have a working knowledge of Node and npm (or maybe Yarn).
   - it’s because these frameworks are all available via npm and rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.

## Conclusion:
- JavaScript is everywhere, and Node is a vast and expansive subject.
- Nonetheless, I hope that in this article I’ve offered you the beginner-friendly, high-level look at Node.js and its main paradigms that I promised at the beginning.
- I also hope that when you re-read the definitions we looked at previously, things will make a lot more sense.
